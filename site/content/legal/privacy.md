# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Jano Foundation, we have a few fundamental principles:

* We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that
  we collect about you through the operation of our services.
* We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
* We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

Hi there! We are the developers behind the Jano Ticketing System. Jano Foundation is an unincorporated
association. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you:

* Use our websites (specifically janoticketing.co.uk and its subdomains);
* Use our other services that are available on or through our websites;
* Contribute to one of our projects on GitHub (under [@jano-may-ball](https://github.com/jano-may-ball));
  and
* Contact us through email.

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website and other services collectively as “Services.”
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our services that have a separate privacy
policy. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that
you have with respect to that information.

### Creative Commons License

This Privacy Policy is based on the [Automattic Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic/blob/master/Privacy-Policy.md)
, which is available under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license. This modified version is also available under the same license. You’re more than welcome to copy
it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so: for example, to provide our Services,
to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when
you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. 
Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of
information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

* **Basic Account Information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
  For example, we require individuals who sign up for a contributor account to provide a username, email
  address and your GitHub username – and that’s it. You may provide us with more information – like your
  name and your address when you sign a Contributor License Agreement – but we don’t require that
  information to create an account.
* **Public Profile Information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you
  provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a community account, your username is part of
  that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo
  or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that – public – so please keep
  that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
* **Communications With Us (Hi There!):** You may also provide us information when you complete forms,
  respond to surveys, or communicate with our developers.

#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information automatically:

* **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers,
  mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique
  device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system,
  and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.
* **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect
  information about the actions that staffs and users perform on the module repository and community – in
  other words, who did what, when and to what thing on the module repository or community. We also collect
  information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, searches at the community,
  interactions with other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen
  size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example,
  provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our
  Services better.
* **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.
  We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from
  certain geographic regions.
* **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website
  stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
  visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and
  emails. Jano Foundation uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and
  track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email
  campaign effectiveness. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for
  tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

#### _Information We Collect from Other Sources_

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your
module repository account through another service (like GitHub), we will receive information from that
service (such as your username and basic profile information) via the authorization procedures used by that
service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are
available. We may get information, such as name and address, from third party sources about individuals
that we have entered into a legal agreement with, which we may use to validate the information we collected
from you and for fraud prevention purposes. We may also get information, such as an email address, from
third party services about individuals who are not yet a contributor (... but we hope will be!), which we
may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.

### How And Why We Use Information

#### _Purposes for Using Information_

We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:

* To provide our Services – for example, to set up and maintain your account and to host your module;
* To further develop and improve our Services – for example by adding new features that we think our users
  will enjoy, will let them download our software faster, or will help them to create and update their
  modules more easily;
* To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us
  improve our Services and make them easier to use;
* To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and
  prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and
  property of Jano Foundation and others, which may result in us declining the use of our Services or the
  contribution from a contributor;
* To communicate with you, for example through an email, to solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date
  on Jano Foundation; and
* To personalize your experience using our Services, and provide content recommendations.

#### _Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information_

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you
under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:

1. The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other
   agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account - for example, in order to enable access
   to our website on your device; or
2. The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
3. The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or
4. We have a legitimate interest in using your information - for example, to provide and update our
   Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard
   our Services, to communicate with you, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to
   personalise your experience; or
5. You have given us your consent - for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access
   and analyse them later on, as described in our Cookie Policy.

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited
circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

* **Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our
  subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the
  information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We
  require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for
  personal information that we share with them.
* **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know
  information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you.
  This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like fraud prevention services that
  allow us to analyse fraudulent transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in
  touch with you, customer email support services that help us communicate with you, and our hosting
  provider), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and
  companies that make modules available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to,
  for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy
  commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific
  policies (e.g. our Cookie Policy).
* **Legal Requests:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or
  other governmental request.
* **To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in
  good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Jano Foundation,
  third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an
  imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency
  without delay.
* **Orgnisation Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of assets, or acquisition of all or a
  portion of our organisation by another organisation, or in the unlikely event that Jano Foundation is
  dissolved or its owner enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is
  transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy
  would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use
  your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
* **With Your Consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For
  example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorise us to do so, such as
  the social media services that you connect to your account.
* **Aggregated or De-Identified Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or
  reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For
  instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
* **Published Support Requests:** And if you send us a request (for example, via a email or one of our
  feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond
  to your request or to help us support other users.

#### _Information Shared Publicly_

Information that you choose to make public is – you guessed it – disclosed publicly. That means, of course,
that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public, and your “Likes” and
comments on our community, are all available to others – and we hope you get a lot of views! The photo on
your public profile, if you have one, along with other public profile information, will display with the
comments and “Likes” that you make. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to
share.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for
which we collect and use it - which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information -
and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we keep the web server logs that
record information about a visitor to one of Jano Foundation’s websites, such as the visitor’s IP address,
browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time
in order to, among other things, analyse traffic to Jano Foundation’s websites and investigate issues if
something goes wrong on one of our websites. As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment
from the community, or a module from the repository the deleted content may remain on our backups and
caches until purged.

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against
unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as
monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. To enhance the security of your account,
we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like two factor authentication.

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

* **Limit the Information that You Provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide
  the optional account information and profile information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide
  this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible, and you may not be able to
  contribute to our projects.
* **Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:** At this time, Jano Foundation does not respond to “do not track” 
  signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or
  reject browser cookies before using Jano Foundation’s websites, with the drawback that certain features
  of Jano Foundation’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
* **Close Your Account:** While we’d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services,
  you can close your account. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after
  closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above - for example, when that
  information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations
  such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.

### Your Rights

If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General
Data Protection Regulation (that is, the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your
personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

* Request access to your personal data;
* Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
* Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
* Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
* Request portability of your personal data.

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we
offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights,
scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us. EU individuals also have the right to
make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

### Controllers and Responsible Companies

**Jano Foundation** is the controller of your personal information, which means that we are responsible for
processing that information. 

### How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights
mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@janoticketing.co.uk).

### Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)

#### _Transferring Information_

Because Jano Foundation’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when
you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the
European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, or third party data processors. This is required for the
purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you
to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your
personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These
measures include:

* Entering into European Commission approved contractual arrangements with them.

You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when
transferring it from the EU.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Jano Foundation may change its Privacy Policy from time to
time. Jano Foundation encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy
Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may
provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage), or sending you a notification
through email or the community). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will
be subject to the updated policy.

### That’s it! Thanks for reading.
