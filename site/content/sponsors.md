All product names, logos, and brands used are not us - but we did ask before using them.
The fact that we included their names and logos does not mean that they endorsed us.
Although we think our sponsors are pretty cool, we can't make any guarantees about the
quality of their offerings, or that these offerings would necessarily be fit for your
use.
